    Civil Engineer Major, no background in web development, uses ecommerce sites regularly (3-5 times a week)
    Feedback:
    Unclear how to navigate through the site, lack of a counter or cart to keep track of what I have added to my cart makes it difficult to use the site.

    Background:
    Computer Science Major, background in frontend and backend web development, uses ecommerce sites occasionally (2-3 times a week)
    Feedback:
    Site is difficult to naviagate through without a clear roadmap or customer interaction, site's login button does not work or direct user anywhere and the cart that appears on the second page is static.

    Information Technology and Management Major, background in web development, has taken ITMD362, uses ecommerce sites frequently (5-7 times a week)
    Feedback:
    Site colors and design are a bit weird, feels like I'm going to get a virus, the website is not properly optimized for the viewport.
