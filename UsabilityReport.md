Project 3: Usability Report
Team Magnezing: Shahaan Mirza, Tyler Wyzykowski, Zach Watson, Matthew Bellario

* Objective
    The objective of this report is to better understand how real users interact with and utilize our website. By conducting these tests we will learn what works, what needs improvement, and what can be added or removed entirely. The report will help to organize that information.
    
* Testing Methodology
    For this project we followed the suggestions in Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think." We followed the following questioning format: introduction, pre-screening questions, home page tour, tasks, probing, and conclusion. Using our "Usability Testing Template" we were able to keep tests on track and ensrure a consistent standard for testing.
    Demographic questions help to better understand the tester's personal experience and history and how that may affect their interaction with the site. Tasks help to see how the user will interact directly with the site and how they will troubleshoot and problem solve issues.
