Project 3: Usability Report
Team Magnezing: Shahaan Mirza, Tyler Wyzykowski, Zach Watson, Matthew Bellario

* Objective
    The objective of this report is to better understand how real users interact with and utilize our website. By conducting these tests we will learn what works, what needs improvement, and what can be added or removed entirely. The report will help to organize that information.

* Testing Methodology
    For this project we followed the suggestions in Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think." We followed the following questioning format: introduction, pre-screening questions, home page tour, tasks, probing, and conclusion. Using our "Usability Testing Template" we were able to keep tests on track and ensure a consistent standard for testing.
    Demographic questions help to better understand the tester's personal experience and history and how that may affect their interaction with the site. Tasks help to see how the user will interact directly with the site and how they will troubleshoot and problem solve issues.

* Test Results
  From the tests conducted on our website and interviewing them on the site overall. The testers were able to determine the site was an online store that sold goods mainly targeted towards band merchandise from the t-shirts.

  On the appearance of the website, some liked aspects of how it looked, and some thought the appearance visuals could use improvement such as the font size and remove button compared to the purchase item image size.

  The testers were able navigate to the login page and properly fill out the forum. The testers ran into problems and were confused, however, When it came to determining whether or not their information was created without any confirmation from the site.

  The users were properly able to fill out the shipping and billing forums. During one of the tests a user was able to see the previous users billing credentials which should not be visible to a separate user.

  When it came to the process of going through the cart, the users ran into multiple problems such as confirmation of determining whether or not the item was added to the cart or removed from the cart or what was in the cart at that given moment. The cart shopping page responsiveness needs improvement.

  The users also commented visual clarity of what page they were on as they looked at the search bar to be certain on what page of the website they were on. The testers gave valuable experience on what they liked, disliked, and areas and aspects of the site that needed improvement.

* Necessary Changes
- Add page titles and change page title typography
  Users had difficulty understanding where they were located on the website. Adding page titles where one cannot be found should aid users encountering the same issue. Changing the typography to bring attention to said titles is another method to help guide users through the site.

- Update the main navigation bar style
  The current navigation bar has a vertical style when it should be horizontal. Users suggest a centralized navigation bar may not be the best choice.

- Fix cart functionality
  Users did not know if their items were added to the cart or not. Adding and removing from the cart should be made more apparent. A working counter of items should be implemented. Prices should be updated when changes are made to the cart.

- Improve overall typography
  Current size for "add to cart" and "remove" buttons is too small. Fonts can be better selected to promote readability. Ensuring sizes are legible and can guide users also promotes readability.

- Fix security issue
  Data for a user should not be seen or accessible to other users on separate devices.
